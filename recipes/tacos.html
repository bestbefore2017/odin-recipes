    <h1>Crispy Fried Ground Beef Tacos</h1>
    <img src="../images/tacos.jpg" alt="A plate of classic beef tacos" />
    <p>These crispy fried ground beef tacos are made by filling tortillas as you fry them, folding in cheese and taco meat, then carefully opening them to dress with lettuce, salsa, sour cream, and cilantro.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1/3 cup finely chopped onion</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons taco seasoning</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
        <li>2/3 cup water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup oil, divided</li>
        <li>12 corn tortillas</li>
        <li>8 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, shredded</li>
        <li>lettuce, salsa, sour cream, and cilantro for topping</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <b>Step 1</b>
    <p>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef and cook, breaking up clumps with a spatula, until fat renders out and beef begins to brown, about 4 minutes. Add onion and cook, stirring constantly until onion is softened and beef is crumbly, about 4 minutes. Drain fat if desired.</p>
    <b>Step 2</b>
    <p>Add desired amount of taco seasoning and cook for 1 minute. Add in tomato paste and water and cook, using a spoon to loosen any browned bits from the pan, and stir until well combined. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes.</p>
    <b>Step 3</b>
    <p>Heat 1/4 cup oil in a large deep skillet over medium-high heat. Carefully place tortilla in hot oil until it begins to bubble and brown. Flip tortilla and top with 2 tablespoons shredded cheese all over. Next, add about 1/4 cup ground beef mixture on half of the tortilla. Using tongs and a spatula, carefully fold tortilla in half and cook until well browned on both sides. Drain well on paper towels. Repeat with remaining oil, tortillas, taco meat and cheese.</p>
    <b>Step 4</b>
    <p>Carefully open and fill tacos as desired. Serve immediately.</p>
